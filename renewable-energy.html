      <h4>
        Already, economics favor wind and sun over fossil fuels in many places. A shift away from coal-powered electricity is underway in the United States, the United Kingdom, and much of Europe, albeit not fast or widespread enough. The speed of transformation is the issue at hand. We must curtail and supplant 19th and 20th-century forms of production more rapidly—including the large pipeline of proposed new coal plants—while ensuring that the future of clean electricity is equitable and empowering for all.</h4><hr>

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <hr>
      <h4>Enhance Efficiency</h4>
      <p>Electricity efficiency solutions include technologies and practices that reduce demand for electricity generation, literally lightening the load. The two biggest end-users of electricity are buildings and industry, in roughly equal measure. While a home or factory may be the location of efficiency measures, these emissions get counted at the power plant where they are created or avoided, as part of the electricity sector. (See further exploration of buildings and industry below.)</p>
      <h4>Shift Production</h4>
      <p>Production of electricity must move away from fossil fuels, as quickly as possible. A spectrum of solutions can help, from small-scale/distributed to large-scale/centralized. Some solutions harvest photons from the sun. Others tap nature’s generous kinetic energy—the movement of wind and water. Still others use an alternate source of heat, such as geothermal or nuclear, for the same basic steam-turbine process.</p>
      <h4>Improve the System</h4>
      <p>To enable the transition to renewable electricity production and use, the broader electricity system also needs to evolve and upgrade. Flexible grids for transmission and effective energy storage make it possible to better balance electricity supply with demand.</p>
