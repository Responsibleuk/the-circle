            <h2>Identify limiting beliefs</h2>
            <p>During the first few months of working with your life coach, you will work with your coach to identify
              limiting beliefs that are holding you back from unlocking an extraordinary life. Before you can tackle
              goals in your career, relationship or
              health, you must first do inner work to develop a greater understanding of yourself, your habits and how
              you
              view yourself and the world.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Overcoming the limiting beliefs</h2>
            <p>The next three to six months of work with your life or business coach will focus on developing patterns
              to
              help you overcome these beliefs and achieve breakthroughs. These patterns will become regular habits that
              you can use for the rest of your life.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Reinforce patterns and achieve goals</h2>
            <p>The rest of your work with your personal life coach will focus on reinforcing your new patterns and using
              them to achieve the goals you set in the beginning of your coaching program. As you achieve goals, your
              life
              coach will celebrate your successes with you and help you set new goals to tackle.</p>
