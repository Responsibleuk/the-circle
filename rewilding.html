                Rewilding encourages a balance between people and the rest of nature so that we thrive together. It can
                provide opportunities for communities to diversify and create nature-based economies; for living systems
                to provide the ecological functions on which we all depend; and for people to reconnect with wild
                nature.

                A third of the food raised or prepared does not make it from farm or factory to fork. Producing uneaten
                food
                squanders a whole host of resources—seeds, water, energy, land, fertilizer, hours of labor, financial
                capital—and generates greenhouse gases at every stage—including methane when organic matter lands in the
                global rubbish bin. The food we waste is responsible for roughly 8 percent of global emissions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Losing food to one waste heap or another is an issue in both high- and low-income countries. In places
                where
                income is low, wastage is generally unintentional and occurs earlier in the supply chain—food rots on
                farms
                or
                spoils during storage or distribution. In regions of higher income, willful food waste dominates farther
                along
                the supply chain. Retailers and consumers reject food based on bumps, bruises, and coloring, or simply
                order,
                buy, and serve too much.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are numerous and varied ways to address key waste points. In lower-income countries, improving
                infrastructure for storage, processing, and transportation is essential. In higher-income regions, major
                interventions are needed at the retail and consumer levels. National food-waste targets and policies can
                encourage widespread change. Beyond addressing emissions, these efforts can also help to meet future
                food
                demand.
