Our mission is to create a global wellness community around the ideas and practices of sustainability, simplicity and resilience.

We call it sustainable life strategies and you can think of it as a cross between Greta Thunberg and Tony Robbins.

The Circle aims to inform, educate and challenge the way we think about sustainability and climate change.

It is a first of it's kind personal development agency tha aims to not only bring the earth back to life, but also bring ourselves back to life, bringing our essence, our spirit, our sense of purpose back to life. It’s about bringing meaning to our lives while saving our planet.

The website begins with educating users about sustainability, as you progress through the site you learn more including reasons to be hopefull. This is meant to inspire people into action before moving onto things people can actually do in there own lives, finally the site tells users about the coaching services offered from The Circle.
