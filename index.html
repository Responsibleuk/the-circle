      <h4>
        Roughly a third of the world’s food is never eaten, which means land and resources used and greenhouse gases
        emitted in producing it were unnecessary. Interventions can reduce loss and waste, as food moves from farm to
        fork, thereby reducing overall demand.

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        A third of the food raised or prepared does not make it from farm or factory to fork. Producing uneaten food
        squanders a whole host of resources—seeds, water, energy, land, fertilizer, hours of labor, financial
        capital—and generates greenhouse gases at every stage—including methane when organic matter lands in the
        global rubbish bin. The food we waste is responsible for roughly 8 percent of global emissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Losing food to one waste heap or another is an issue in both high- and low-income countries. In places where
        income is low, wastage is generally unintentional and occurs earlier in the supply chain—food rots on farms
        or
        spoils during storage or distribution. In regions of higher income, willful food waste dominates farther
        along
        the supply chain. Retailers and consumers reject food based on bumps, bruises, and coloring, or simply
        order,
        buy, and serve too much.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are numerous and varied ways to address key waste points. In lower-income countries, improving
        infrastructure for storage, processing, and transportation is essential. In higher-income regions, major
        interventions are needed at the retail and consumer levels. National food-waste targets and policies can
        encourage widespread change. Beyond addressing emissions, these efforts can also help to meet future food
        demand.
