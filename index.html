    <main>The Circle aims to inform, educate and challenge the way we think helping to
      create a new collective consciousness that is needed to save our planet. We simplify the foundations of
      sustainability, explain the facts but also inspire people into taking action and direct them to the relevant

        Roughly a third of the world’s food is never eaten, which means land and resources used and greenhouse gases
        emitted in producing it were unnecessary. Interventions can reduce loss and waste, as food moves from farm to
        fork, thereby reducing overall demand.

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        A third of the food raised or prepared does not make it from farm or factory to fork. Producing uneaten food
        squanders a whole host of resources—seeds, water, energy, land, fertilizer, hours of labor, financial
        capital—and generates greenhouse gases at every stage—including methane when organic matter lands in the
        global rubbish bin. The food we waste is responsible for roughly 8 percent of global emissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Losing food to one waste heap or another is an issue in both high- and low-income countries. In places where
        income is low, wastage is generally unintentional and occurs earlier in the supply chain—food rots on farms
        or
        spoils during storage or distribution. In regions of higher income, willful food waste dominates farther
        along
        the supply chain. Retailers and consumers reject food based on bumps, bruises, and coloring, or simply
        order,
        buy, and serve too much.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are numerous and varied ways to address key waste points. In lower-income countries, improving
        infrastructure for storage, processing, and transportation is essential. In higher-income regions, major
        interventions are needed at the retail and consumer levels. National food-waste targets and policies can
        encourage widespread change. Beyond addressing emissions, these efforts can also help to meet future food
        demand.

  <ol>
    <li>Our name <b>The Circle</b> is influenced by the circular economy and the shape of our planet which we are
      trying to
      save</li>
    <li>It takes more energy to make 1 kg of paper than it takes to make 1 kg of steel</li>
    <li>It takes almost 500,000 litres of water to extract just 1 kg of gold</li>
    <li>1 kwh of electricity from a UK plug socket takes almost 3 kwh of energy to produce</li>
    <li>Switching from the font ‘Arial’ to ‘Century Gothic’ saves 30% ink on printing</li>
    <li>More energy is wasted in the UK’s electricity generation system than is consumed to heat all of the UK’s
      homes</li>
    <li>There is up to 30 times more gold in a tonne of old mobile phones than in a tonne of gold ore</li>
    <li>Around 16,000 litres of water is consumed to make just 1 kg of beef</li>
    <li>Recycling a single 330 ml aluminium drink can saves enough energy to power a TV for over 3 hours</li>
    <li>It takes around 2,700 litres of water to make a single cotton t-shirt</li>
    <li>The embodied carbon of constructing an average UK house is equivalent to driving around the earth over 10
      times</li>
    <li>23 new steps have been added to Mexico City’s Angel of Independence. Over-abstraction of ground water has
      caused the city to sink 9 m in the last 100 years</li>
    <li>1 tonne of CO2e is enough to power a UK light bulb for 10 years. In France it’s enough for over 50 years
    </li>
    <li>Transporting goods by a rigid road truck is over 70 times more carbon intensive than bulk shipping</li>
    <li>Disposable batteries produce 50 times less energy than the embodied energy of production</li>
