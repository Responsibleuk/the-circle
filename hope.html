                <p>Innovations being used to reduce CO2 emissions include carbon capture, utilisation, and storage technologies - with the Net Zero Teesside (NZT) project being an interesting example.</p>
                <p>NZT aims to capture CO2 produced in industrial processes and power plants and transport these emissions by pipeline to offshore storage sites several kilometres beneath the North Sea.</p>
                <p>Sequestered in secure areas deep beneath the sea, this carbon would no longer contribute to the greenhouse effect - and it could even be synthesised into new fuels for transportation systems in the future.</p>
                <p>The aim, as the NZT project's name suggests, will be to reduce carbon emissions in a number of carbon-intensive industries in the North East to zero by as early as 2030.
                    But the scale of the Earth's problem is far more significant than can be solved by the selective decarbonisation of a low number of businesses.</p>
