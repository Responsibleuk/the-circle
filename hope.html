                    utilisation, and storage
                    technologies - with the Net Zero Teesside (NZT) project being an interesting example.
                </p>
                <p>NZT aims to capture CO2 produced in industrial processes and power plants and transport
                    these
                    emissions by pipeline to offshore storage sites several kilometres beneath the North

                <p>Sequestered in secure areas deep beneath the sea, this carbon would no longer contribute
                    to the
                    greenhouse effect - and it could even be synthesised into new fuels for transportation
                    systems in
                    the future.</p>
                <p>The aim, as the NZT project's name suggests, will be to reduce carbon emissions in a
                    number of
                    carbon-intensive industries in the North East to zero by as early as 2030.

                <p>Another significant greenhouse gas is methane, emissions of which are reaching record
                    levels due to
                    cattle farming.</p>
                <p>Agriculture accounted for roughly two-thirds of all methane emissions related to human
                    activities
                    between 2000 and 2017 according to one recent study, with fossil fuels contributing most
                    of the
                    remaining third.</p>
                <p>This methane primarily comes from burping cattle, due to how cows digest food -
                    fermenting it in
                    their stomachs where the sugars are converted into simpler molecules that can be
                    absorbed by the
                    body.</p>
                <p>Scientists have discovered that a red seaweed which grows in the tropics can reduce
                    methane emissions
                    by 80% in cows when it is added as a supplement to cattle feed.</p>

                    technological
                    solutions to climate change, innovative food creation definitely does.</p>
                <p>Another interesting way to reduce the methane pollution from cattle farming would be to
                    replace the
                    beef with a substitute made from insects - and this is already taking off in places.</p>
                <p>Protein-rich insects such as mealworms can be farmed without the demands on land or water
                    that cattle
                    farming requires - but even if the insects are high in protein there are a number of
                    other crucial
                    nutrients which humans generally only find in meat - including iron.</p>

                <p>The Centre for Climate Repair at the University of Cambridge is investigating a number of
                    ideas which
                    would repair the damage being done by human pollution.</p>
                <p>Among their ideas are refreezing the poles by brightening the clouds above them,
                    essentially by
                    spraying tiny drops of salt into the sky to assist the clouds in reflecting radiation
                    back into
                    space.</p>
                <p>Another suggestion has been "greening" the oceans, essentially fertilising them to
                    encourage the
                    growth of plant matter and algae which could absorb more CO2.</p>
                <p>However some research warns that this could cause enormous disruption to the oceans'
                    ecosystems, and
                    potentially wouldn't even then be able to capture enough CO2 to offset emissions.</p>

            <figcaption class="tech-figcaption">
                <p>As the coronavirus pandemic has shown, many office jobs can be successfully fulfilled
                    from home -
                    potentially offering a route to reduce emissions from transport and office buildings.
                </p>
                <p>Driving to and from work is the largest source of carbon emissions in the developed
                    world.</p>
                <p>The technology to support remote working has been rapidly adopted as businesses attempted
                    to manage
                    the impact of COVID-19 on their workers, and governments rushed to lock down their
                    countries and
                    prevent mass deaths.</p>
                <p>It turns out that when buildings need to be heated during the winter it is much more
                    efficient to
                    have numerous people in a single building rather than distributed across their own
                    homes, and some
                    research suggests this might even offset the emissions from transportation.</p>

            <figcaption class="tech-figcaption">
                <p>A similar logic regarding the heating of individual homes versus office buildings can be
                    applied when
                    it comes to computation.</p>
                <p>The advent of computers has increased electricity consumption considerably, but modern
                    data centres
                    are often far more energy efficient than personal computers.</p>
                <p>Rather than performing energy-intensive applications on local machines - from crunching
                    complicated
                    numbers through to playing video games - people could begin to offset a considerable
                    amount of
                    energy expenditure by having these applications performed in the cloud.</p>
                <p>The big technology companies which specialise in providing cloud computing services -
                    Amazon, Google
                    and Microsoft - are large consumers of renewable energy.</p>

            <figcaption class="tech-figcaption">
                <p>The single-most effective technological solution to climate change is going to be
                    reducing energy
                    consumption overall, and nothing is going to do that more than making homes more energy
                    efficient.
                </p>
                <p>The technology to achieve this is already there, with many of the newest products on the
                    market
                    capable of shaving hundreds of pounds off of household bills annually.</p>
                <p>Energy savings made through design innovations for these household goods might be small
                    individually,
                    but they have the potential to scale and significantly impact energy consumption across
                    the course
                    of a year for a household, and even more significantly across all households in a
                    country.</p>
