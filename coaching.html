      <p>In recent years, more and more people are seeing the benefits of working with life coaches for their personal
        growth and development, and are turning to coaches for help solving their problems, and making steps towards
        their goals. The Circle is life coaching for individuals who not only want to become the best version of
        themselves but also want to save the planet.</p>

      <h2 class="hope-heading">What Is Life Coaching?</h2>
      <p>First thing is first, what is life coaching? Well, at its most basic, life coaching is a non-directive,
        collaborative conversation between coach and coachee that can enable profound change through choices, questions,
        reflections and new behaviours. As part of this process, clients are empowered to make courageous decisions
        about their life, work, relationships, and more.</p>
      <p>The key thing here is that the coach helps to empower the client in making these decisions for themselves.
        There is no guidance from the coach, and it is precisely this element of the life coaching dynamic that makes
        the impact and change often so profound for the coachee.</p>

      <h2 class="hope-heading">Do i need a coach?</h2>
      <p>When it comes to building your personal brand, a coach can be a powerful resource who can help you get out of
        your
        own way, stand out, and take action to achieve the things that are truly important to you. ... Coaches help you
        figure out what you don't know, and they clue you in to things you may not be able to see.</p>

          <h5>Does that mean your personal life coach will be better than you in the specific goal you are passionate
            about and
            focusing on? Not necessarily. Freddy Roach was never a better boxer than Manny Pacquiau. But Freddy was an
            outstanding trainer he could develop winning strategies, and bringing out the best in his
            fighters. The same can be said of other legendary coaches like Vince Lombardy or Alex Fergusson – quality
            coaches drive quality results.
            That is the kind of value and expertise your sustainability life strategist will bring to your life.</h5>
