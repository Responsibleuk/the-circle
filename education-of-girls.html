                to provide the ecological functions on which we all depend; and for people to reconnect with wild

            <p>
                There is no one-size-fits-all solution to the interrelated crises of wildlife extinctions, climate change and pandemics. The Circle works with local and Indigenous communities, conservation partners, governments and others to solve some of the world’s most pressing environmental challenges. Our wildlands approaches include any combination of the following solutions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Conducting scientific research, synthesizing data and using that information to prioritize our conservation efforts and enable a deeper understanding of global biodiversity, its status and how best to conserve it.</li>
                <li>Identifying and prioritizing wildlands in need of increased protection status, including establishing new protected and conserved areas, Indigenous-managed territories, and private protected areas in these places.</li>
                <li>Improving the way protected and conserved areas are managed—involving communities, Indigenous peoples, sociology, economics, business management, and wildlife crime prevention—to ensure a safer future for biodiversity and local communities.</li>
                <li>Supporting extensive native habitat restoration, such as reforestation, that assists in the recovery of ecosystems that have been degraded or destroyed, but that can rebound and rewild with a little help.</li>
                <li>Developing community-led and owned prevention strategies that take into account the societal and cultural drivers of wildlife crime, and implementing systems and technology to stop poachers before a crime is even committed.</li>
                <li>Incorporating Indigenous knowledge, practices and values to support Indigenous peoples in protecting and managing their lands and natural resources.</li>
                <li>Partnering with the next generation, passionate leaders, communities and organizations all over the world to ensure they have the enabling conditions, resources and expertise they need to most effectively protect and manage wildlife and wildlands.</li>
                <li>Building a team of engaged global citizens by inspiring changes in daily habits and promoting individual and collective actions that drive real and lasting change. We harness our platforms and reach to generate international attention around imminent threats to wildlife and wildlands and the communities who rely on them, usually from extractive industries, to positively influence decision-makers and other stakeholders.</li>
                <li>Exploring some of the most remote corners of our planet to discover how and where we can have the biggest impact on imperiled species and places.</li>
